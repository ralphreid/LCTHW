### Course Projects

The following programming assignments are based on the ones we use in Stanford CS144 'An Introduction to Computer Networks'. Mininet is used to emulate the network topology in these assignments.

* [[Simple Router]] - Implementing a simple IP router
* [[Network Address Translator (NAT)]] - Implementing a simple Network Address Translator
* [[Pee-Wee OSPF (PWOSPF)]] - Implementing a simple link state routing protocol

### Lab Exercises

* [[BufferBloat]] - A simple (potentially in-class) lab exercise to observe the buffer bloat problem using Mininet

### Security Demo
* [[MAC Address Table Overflow Attack]] - A demonstration on MAC address table overflow attack
* [[DHCP Masquerade Attack]] - A demonstration of DHCP masquerade attack
* [[BGP Path Hijacking Attack Demo]] - A demonstration of BGP path hijacking attack

### Reproducible Network Research Experiments

As a project in Stanford's CS244 - 'Advanced Topics in Networking' students recreated published networking research experiments in the Mininet environment.

* [Reproducible Networking Experiments](http://reproducingnetworkresearch.wordpress.com) using Mininet
* [[Reproducible Network Experiments using Container-Based Emulation | http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2012/eproceedings/conext/p253.pdf]] Our paper describing the above.
