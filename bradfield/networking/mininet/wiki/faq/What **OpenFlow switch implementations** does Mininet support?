### What **OpenFlow switch implementations** does Mininet support?

Mininet currently includes support for the user space reference implementations, as well as the Open vSwitch kernel implementation. All three are included in the VM image. Mininet used to support the OpenFlow 0.8.9 kernel reference implementation (`--switch kernel`) but that is now obsolete and has largely been replaced with Open vSwitch.

The command line options are `--switch user` and `--switch ovsk` for the user reference and Open vSwitch kernel switches, respectively.
