### How do I **use Mininet's Python API**?

We provide a few examples of using the Python API in the `mininet/examples` directory.

We also provide Python DocStrings for every Mininet class and method, and you can view them using from within Python

    >>> import mininet.node
    >>> help(mininet.node.Node)</verbatim>

or by calling Python from within the Mininet CLI:

    mininet> py help(h2)

In each case, pressing =q= should quit the pager.

Also see [Mininet-API-Documentation](MininetAPIDocumentation) for information on how to generate Mininet documentation in.md format.
