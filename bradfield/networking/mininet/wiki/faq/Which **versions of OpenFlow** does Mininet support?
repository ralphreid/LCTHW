### Which **versions of OpenFlow** does Mininet support?

Mininet officially supports OpenFlow 1.0, and the Mininet VM image includes OpenFlow 1.0-compatible versions of the OpenFlow reference implementation as well as Open vSwitch. It is also possible to get Mininet to run with OpenFlow 0.8.9 with a few minor changes.
