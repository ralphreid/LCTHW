### Why do the switch data ports have random MAC addresses? How do I assign MAC and IP addresses to the switch data ports?

The MAC addresses reported by Linux for the switch data ports are meaningless. The switch is controlled by OpenFlow, so you should use OpenFlow to ensure that any packets destined "for the switch" are properly routed. You "assign" MAC and IP addresses "to the switch" by using OpenFlow rather than the Linux IP stack. If you attempt to use the Linux IP stack instead, it really won't work unless you are using the Linux kernel for routing (which you aren't - you're using an OpenFlow switch!) You should never attempt to use `ifconfig` or `ip link` or other utilities to assign an IP address to a switch data port. Usually you will want your controller to handle packets such as ARP and ICMP which are sent to and from "the switch," and you will want IP packets which are sent to to be handled by appropriate flow table entries. You can pick any "MAC" address you like for the switch.
