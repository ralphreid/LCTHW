### Why can't I get X11 forwarding to work? I get "cannot open display:" or "$DISPLAY not set" and WireShark doesn't work! `xterm` doesn't work either!

This is not a Mininet problem. It means that X11 forwarding is not set up correctly.
First, consult the X11 setup instructions in the [http://www.openflow.org/wk/index.php/OpenFlow_Tutorial](OpenFlow Tutorial), including:

* Download X11
* Install X11
* Start up X11 server
* Access VM via `ssh`

Make sure you have carefully followed the necessary steps.
If things are still not working for you, you will want to make sure that:

Your X11 server on your client machine (e.g. your laptop) is installed correctly and is actually running
You are connecting using X11 forwarding (e.g. `ssh -X` on OS X/Linux or enabling X11 forwarding in a Windows ssh client like PuTTY or SecureCRT.)

You don't have any options in your client `.ssh/config` which interfere with X11 forwarding

When you log in with `ssh`, your `$DISPLAY` environment variable is set
X11 terminology is a bit confusing because the X11 server is actually run on the ssh client machine! The ssh client connects to the sshd server, which in turn forwards connections from X11 client applications (such as wireshark) to the local X11 server (usually running on your laptop or whatever machine is sitting in front of you.)

One note: if you have disabled IPv6, you may find that you need to add `AddressFamily inet` to your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.

Other unlikely causes of breaking X11 forwarding include it being disabled in `/etc/sshd_config` or disabled by SELinux. Neither of these should be the case in the Mininet VM image we provide.
You may wish to invoke debug logging on your ssh client to see why X11 forwarding isn't working. On OS X and Linux, you can use

    ssh -X -v <VM's IP address>

to see where the X11 forwarding is failing.

If this seems too complicated, you can simply run X11 in the VM console window
First, log in to the VM in its console window (i.e. type directly into the VM window without using `ssh`.) Then, install `xinit` (and its dependencies) and a window manager of your choice (I picked `flwm` because it's small - you may prefer `metacity` or some other window manager):

    sudo apt-get install xinit flwm

Then, you can start X11 in the VM console window using

    startx

As an alternative to X11, you could also use VNC, but that is probably about as complicated as X11 and is left as an exercise to the reader.
