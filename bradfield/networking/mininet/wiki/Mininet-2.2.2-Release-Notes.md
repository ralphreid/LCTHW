Mininet 2.2.2 is primarily a bug fix and compatibility release for Mininet 2.2.1.

### Security Fix/Advisory!

* The Mininet VM image no longer includes the same, identical `ssh` key for everyone, and should instead generate new ones the first time it is booted(!!) *[In my opinion, the `.ovf` spec should include an option (and the OS should include a mechanism) to regenerate `ssh` keys and MAC addresses, since the issue is likely to occur in any VM image with `ssh` installed!]*

* We recommend that you regenerate any default keys in use in Mininet (or derived) VMs:

      sudo rm -f /etc/ssh/*key*
      sudo /usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
      sudo service ssh restart                              

* We recommend that you use the Mininet 2.2.2 or newer VM images.

### Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial) Compatibility

* **Kernel Bug Returns!** :( Unfortunately, the annoying  kernel bug that causes `unshare()` to hang (and Mininet to stop working until you reboot) has returned. You may see a message like `unregister_netdevice: waiting for lo to become free. Usage count = 1` in the console or kernel log. Until this is fixed, we don't recommend using 16.04 (or the Linux 3.16 kernel.)

* We no longer attempt to delete a nonexistent root `qdisc` if one is not present (thanks to Olivier Tilmans)

* `xenial` VMs can now be created using `build.py`

### Ubuntu 15 (Utopic) Compatibility

* We support `openvswitch-testcontroller` in Ubuntu 15. Note this controller is deprecated and not present in Ubuntu 16.

### Code Check and Continuous Integration

* We now run public CI builds via Travis
* The builds include a code check using `pylint` on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Notable Bug Fixes or Workarounds

* We've been seeing a variety of performance test failures running under kvm, so the constraints on some performance tests have been relaxed slightly.

* A race condition that could cause `Mininet.iperf()` to fail has been addressed. (#589)

* We have forked the Stanford OpenFlow 1.0 reference controller and `oflops` and use our own versions in the Mininet VM image. Note these are somewhat obsolete.

* `install.sh` has basic support for RHEL.

* `mnexec` explicitly recursively marks mounts as private; this should fix compatibility with `systemd` based systems which inexplicably require the default mount namespace behavior to be shared. ;-( (#565)

* The default OpenFlow port is now the official port of 6653 rather than the classic port of 6633, which was nastily co-opted by Cisco.

* NAT can use all interfaces.

* `ip_forward` is restored to its original state after NAT shuts down

* An option has been added to the `NAT` element, and `iptables` are not flushed by default.

* The NAT element now correctly attaches to the switch that is specified in its parameters.

* A number of tests have been revised to make them more reliable.

### Bugs and gotchas

* Ryu installation with `install.sh -y` is still broken

* The `--tests` option is slightly different from mainline, accepting multiple test names rather than
  parameters for the test. Please do not depend on this functionality in 2.2.2, or update to mainline if
  you require the new functionality.

* As noted, Ubuntu 16.04+/Linux 4.4 includes a kernel regression which breaks container systems with the
  `waiting for lo to become free` error. Until this is fixed, we don't recommend those OS/kernel versions.
  If you run into the problem, Mininet will stop working until you reboot.
