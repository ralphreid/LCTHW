Here is a page for information and links to the Mininet Projects for Google Summer of Code 2013, which were selected out of more than 20 applicants who usually based their projects on ideas from the Mininet [[ Project Ideas | Ideas ]] page. (Also see [[ on.lab GSoC page | http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/onlab ]].)

In addition to the pages listed below, we encourage discussion on `mininet-dev`, on `#onlab-gsoc`, and also in GitHub pull requests.

Participants: Please feel free to create the pages for your projects and also to edit this page as desired.
