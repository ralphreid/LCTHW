**Welcome to Mininet**
=======================

Mininet creates scalable (up to hundreds of nodes, depending on your configuration) Software-Defined (e.g. [OpenFlow](Http://Openflow.Org/)) Networks on a single PC by using Linux processes in network namespaces.

It allows you to quickly [create](Sample-Workflow#Creating_a_Network), [interact with](MininetSampleWorkflow#Interacting_with_a_Network), [customize](MininetSampleWorkflow#Customizing_a_Network) and [share](MininetSampleWorkflow#Sharing_a_Network) a software defined network prototype, and provides a smooth path to [running on hardware](MininetSampleWorkflow#Running_on_Hardware).

<!-- BL: not sure about this stuff: 
As a "network laboratory on a laptop", Mininet can run full Unix network applications, and includes a CLI and API for creating and interacting with the virtual network.
