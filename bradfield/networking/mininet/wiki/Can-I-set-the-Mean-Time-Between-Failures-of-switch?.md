Just like we can set the performance of link, such as delay, bandwidth and so on, I would like to set the performance of switch, such as Mean Time Between Failures, but I don't know how to do this.

What's more, I read the mininet API, and find the function addSwitch has a parameter opt, its notes is switch options, what're the options can be used there?

Thank you in advance for your support.
