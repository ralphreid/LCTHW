This page is intended to be a simple reference to community-developed extensions to Mininet and other packages and tools which may be of interest to Mininet users.

(Note that one of the GSoC participants is prototyping a PyPI-like repository for Mininet-compatible Python packages, so that may be available in the future!)

If links are broken, please fix them - thanks! Please also feel free to improve the text descriptions.
