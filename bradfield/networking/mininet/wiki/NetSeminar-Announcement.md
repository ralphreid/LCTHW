Title: Mininet: A Virtual Network on your Laptop

When: 12:00-1:00pm, Thursday November 14, 2013<br>
Where: Gates 104

Lunch will be available at 11:45am.

About the talk:

Network emulation allows you to create realistic, interactive virtual networks in software for research, teaching, learning, experimentation, or general network and distributed systems development, testing and debugging. 

In this talk, we will explain how Linux’s lightweight virtualization facilities can be used to solve the basic technical challenges of creating a realistic virtual network that runs standard networking applications.  We’ll also show how the Mininet [1] system builds on these features to create virtual network topologies of interesting size, and describe how OpenFlow and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) allow experimental network designs with custom packet forwarding to move seamlessly from emulation to hardware for line-rate execution.

It is our hope that anyone with interest and a laptop will be able to understand and use these methods and tools for network and distributed systems learning, experimentation, and development. [2, 3]

Joint work with Brandon Heller, Nikhil Handigol and Vimal Jeyakumar.

About the speakers:

Bob Lantz founded the Mininet project and is currently working on Mininet and SDN projects at the Open Networking Laboratory.  Since completing his Ph.D. at Stanford, he has worked on OpenFlow and related SDN technologies at Stanford, Arista Networks, and DOCOMO USA Labs.

Brian O’Connor earned his B.S. and M.S. at Stanford, where he was introduced to Mininet through various courses and research projects. As a teaching assistant, Brian helped support Mininet usage in the classroom, and he is currently working as a developer for Mininet at Open Networking Laboratory.
